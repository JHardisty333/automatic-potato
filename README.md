# Title
Project two - The Campfire

# Application Description
Teachers have the responsibililty to teach multiple groups of kids each year. To communicate with their students and share online materials for schoolwork they use online portals such as canvas to post the materials for each class period. Our application makes it so teachers can post materials for all of their students in one location instead of having to post in different locations. Teachers have the ability with this application to also leave a message underneath their post so that students can tell which class period the post is for. This application makes it faster for them to post materials which will give them more time for planning lessons. Having more time to plan lessons and make improvements will increase a teachers overall effectiveness in the classroom. Future reworking of the code will allow students to leave comments so that the teachers can get feeback on the material they assigned to the student.

# Application Organization
Backend:
The backend side of the application was organized with a database named automatic_potatoe. We split the information that was going to be put into the database into three different categories which were models User, Newsfeed, and Newupdate. The User model contained the username, email, and password a user would use to login into the website. The Newsfeed model contianed the information associated with posting an article or resource onto the website. The Newupdate model was the model that contained the information associated with the user leaving a comment on an article that was posted. A softwared called Insomnia was used to the test the routes that get information from the models. To put informaiton into our models we used a seeds folder which has preset information for each of the models and puts that information into the models wich the command npm run seeds. 

Frontend: 
We organized the front end by using handlebars for our html code. The handlbars we had for this application are our landing page, login page, and comment page. Our landing page is where a user will see all the articles and resources that have been posted to the application. Underneath the link to the articles or resource the users will see text that describes what the article or resource is about and has a link that leads the user to a page where they can leave comments on the article or resource that was posted. All of the posts are inside a single container. A navigation bar is at the top of the landing page with links that allow the user to login to the application or logout of the application. The login is setup with a container that has cards for the user to login or signup. The login card asks the user for their email and password. The signup card ask the user for their email, username, and password they will use for the application. Both the login and signup cards are inside a conatiner as well. Each of our pages has the background image of people gathered around a campfire because of the idea of having the resorces posted in one place where students and teachers can interact through the comments. Our styling was done with using a CSS stylesheet had been prepared before the backend side of the application was completed.

# Running the Application
The first thing that needs to be done to run our application is to double check and make sure all the necessary software is downloaded onto your computer. The software that needs to be downloaded if necessary, is Visual Studio Code, Node.js, Insomnia, and Gitbash. The links to download all the software will be listed below.
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview">Visual Studio Code Download</a>
- <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Gitbash Download</a>
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js Download For Windows</a>
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js Download For Mac</a>
- <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia Downlad</a>

Next the code needs to be cloned onto visual studio code. The code for this application can be found at our group repository. The link for the repository can be found below
- <a href="https://github.com/JHardisty333/automatic-potato">Repository Link</a>
Click the green code button at the top right corner of the repository to get the shareable link needed to clone the repository into visual studio code. Chose the https code option and then double click on the right side of the mouse after typing git clone into the visual studio code terminal. This will import all of the code onto your computer. If you are not able to use the git clone command due to restrictions put on the repository when the project was created you can open each folder and see the lines of code/and file structure you use in your own repository. Use the same command to put your own repository onto your computer after creating it in github.

After getting the repository onto your computer you will need to install packages from the node.js library to prevent errors when loading the application for the first time. To intstall the packages type the command npm i in the terminal to download all of the packages needed for the application. All that is left is to get the application up and running which is done by typing the command npm start in the computer. Once it says the server is connected simply type http://localhost:3001 and the application will pull up.
